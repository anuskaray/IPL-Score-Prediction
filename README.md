# IPL-Score-Prediction
This is a Project on Big Data Analytics where we used python and visualisation tools like zoho to visualise and analyse the IPL data. 

INTRODUCTION

As we all know, the Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the most popular and highly-anticipated cricket tournaments in the world. With
INTRODUCTION
the increasing amount of data available for every aspect of the game, it has become essential to apply big data analytics to accurately predict the outcome of matches.
The objective of our project is to use big data techniques to analyze past IPL data, including player statistics, team performance, match location, and other relevant factors, to predict the scores of upcoming matches. By leveraging advanced data analytics tools and machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide accurate and reliable predictions that can help cricket enthusiasts make informed decisions and improve their chances of winning.
Our project will involve the collection, cleaning, and preprocessing of large datasets from various sources, followed by exploratory data analysis and feature engineering. We will then apply several machine learning techniques, such as regression, classification, and time-series analysis, to build predictive models that can forecast the scores of upcoming matches. Finally, we will evaluate the performance of our models using various metrics and validate our results through cross- validation and other statistical techniques.
We believe that our project has significant potential to improve the accuracy of IPL score predictions and provide valuable insights into the game of cricket. We look forward to sharing our findings and contributing to the growing field of big data analytics in sports.

PROJECT STATEMENT

The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model for Indian Premier League (IPL) score prediction using big data analytics techniques. The model will be trained on historical data from previous IPL matches, including team and player statistics, weather conditions, pitch information, and other relevant factors. The model will use python programing and different tools of visualisations to analyse and extract patterns from the data. The predicted scores will be compared with actual scores to evaluate the accuracy of the model. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a reliable and accurate model that can be used to predict the scores of IPL matches in real- time and assist in making informed decisions for betting or fantasy league teams.
